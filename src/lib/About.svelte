      <p>
        Hi! I am a frontend developer with a passion for
        creating elegant and functional user interfaces.
        Right now I am studying at the University of the
        Valley of Guatemala, and I'm currently a third-year
        Computer Science student.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love taking long walks while listening and discovering
        new music. I also love to play videogames, watch some
        movies, play volleyball and learning new things!
